            <h2> My hobbies and interests</h2>
             I like to draw cartoon animals in my sketchbook with my free time. I enjoy photography as my elective in school because it provides opportunities for me to capture moments that look very cool. I play a variety of PC games and I watch alot of TV in my spare time at home.           <br> 
             <h2> What I aspire to be</h2>
            I have a lot of ideas of what career I may want to pursue in the future, some of those being a costume maker, doctor, veteranarian or a hireable cartoon artist. What I want to be is still up in the air, because there are many pros and cons to working in each job, and each job has its own unique benefits, so I am just keeping a general idea of what I want to be, not an exact picture of what I want to be.
